# DjangoHello

This is an intial setup of Django using the IDE PYCHARM to create a hello world file.

Video used was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck8XDGnM2aA&list=PLhTjy8cBISEpXc-yjjSW90NgNyPYe7c9_&index=4

I found this walkthrough very helpful in understanding the views and how Django relates to other frameworks. 

The documentation I used was https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/
  This website has great documentation and also has tutorials to follow to learn Django.
